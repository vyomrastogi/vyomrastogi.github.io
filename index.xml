      <description>Collection Name with “-” While getting started with MongoDB, I created my first collection with name “june-collection”. I did this directly using spring-data-mongodb library.
Mongo doesn’t restrict collection name with -, but while using mongo shell in windows, e.g. db.june-collection.deleteMany , the shell gives error saying “collection” is not recognized (the string after - in the collection name)
After some googling, found that collection name with “-” is not one of the best approaches.</description>

      <description>Java Java is a high level programming language. Main characteristics include
 robust secure platform/os independent object-oriented multi-threaded portable (read-once-write-anywhere) etc.  Java requires both compiler and interpretor to run.
The compiler converts the source code into byte code. The interpretor interprets this bytecode and excutes the application/logic. Since java is interpreted language, it is platform independent
Java Virtual Machine or JVM provides an environment to support execution of java bytecode.</description>

      <description>What is DNS and how it works? DNS : Domain Naming System All the electonice devices connected to internet communicate to each other via a sequence of numbers called ipaddresses. Since it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for humans to remember these IPAddresses, there is a central server which translates the requested resource name to an ip address. It&amp;rsquo;s like a phonebook with domain name and ipaddresses.
Types of DNS Servers  DNS Recursive servers  These are provided by ISP provider (internet providers), which assign an ipaddress to one&amp;rsquo;s machine.</description>
