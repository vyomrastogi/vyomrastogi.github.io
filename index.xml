      <description>Collection Name with “-” While getting started with MongoDB, I created my first collection with name “june-collection”. I did this directly using spring-data-mongodb library.
Mongo doesn’t restrict collection name with -, but while using mongo shell in windows, e.g. db.june-collection.deleteMany , the shell gives error saying “collection” is not recognized (the string after - in the collection name)
After some googling, found that collection name with “-” is not one of the best approaches.</description>

      <description>Java Java is a high level programming language. Main characteristics include
 robust secure platform/os independent object-oriented multi-threaded portable (read-once-write-anywhere) etc.  Java requires both compiler and interpretor to run.
The compiler converts the source code into byte code. The interpretor interprets this bytecode and excutes the application/logic. Since java is interpreted language, it is platform independent
Java Virtual Machine or JVM provides an environment to support execution of java bytecode.</description>

      <description>What is Internet? Internet is global network of billions of electronic devices and computer. It is possible to access almost any information, communicate wit anyone in world using internet.
How does Internet work? Internet is global network of physical cables/optical fibres which directly/indirectly connect all the electronice devices.</description>

      <description>The Stack Memory  There can be multiple stacks In general in a stack data structure, as new elements are added the elements are pushed down in stack, while popping the first element is pushed out first. First in Last Out datastructure. Java store local variables of a class or method in stack, and are popped off the stack when it encounters end of function block or class block In general the variables stored in stack have very short lifetime.</description>

      <description>What is DNS and how it works? DNS : Domain Naming System All the electonice devices connected to internet communicate to each other via a sequence of numbers called ipaddresses. Since it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for humans to remember these IPAddresses, there is a central server which translates the requested resource name to an ip address. It&amp;rsquo;s like a phonebook with domain name and ipaddresses.
Types of DNS Servers  DNS Recursive servers  These are provided by ISP provider (internet providers), which assign an ipaddress to one&amp;rsquo;s machine.</description>

      <description>Java avoids memory leakage by
 running on a java virtual machine it adopts a garbage collection strategy: Any object which is not reachable from stack memory are eligible for garbage collection -System.gc() is a suggestion to JVM to run garbage collection, and not a gaurantee that all objects will be garbage collected. Usually it is not possible to have memory leaks from jvm to os, but sometimes there can be a soft leak.</description>

      <description>What are browsers and how do they work? A browser is an application which helps user to view a website.
It mainly consists of
 User Interface [the UI of a browser which lets user enter a webaddress, refresh etc] Rendering Engine  The engine where DOM is converted to a webpage as we see it This layer is responsible for making all network requests, parse the html and request for more resources required   Browser Engine [Maintains communication between Browser UI and Rendering Engine] Network [To get data from various sources] Javascript Interpretor  It provides interpretor for javascript which is used to provide various interactive features on the webpage   Data Storage [for storing cache,cookies, history etc]  </description>

      <description>How to find which methods are being compiled to native byte code by compiler.
 By running the class with flag *PrintCompilation * turned on.-XX:+PrintCompilation    There are two level of compiler in java C1 and C2
 On the basis of number of times a code block is used, it keeps on getting compiled at a more deeper tier. The first three level of compilation are done by C1 Compiler The C2 Compiler, compiles the code to native byte code as well places the code in code cache, hence even faster code execution.</description>

      <description>What is HTTP? HyperText Transfer Protocol
 Client/Server model or request/response model Stateless a lot of application maintain state via session/cookie Application Layer internally uses TCP protocol. TCP defines how the data is read/decoded Client Action (GET, PUT/POST, DELETE, PATCH) Server Status Codes Headers  </description>

      <description>List Implementations  ArrayList  instantiated as array in memory with size of 10 elements    CopyOnWriteArrayList  Is thread safe version of Arraylist Is very costly in terms of ordinality Can be used when  application is multi-threaded multiple threads need to access the same list no. of iterations or reads are lot more than no. of writes/addition or deletion     AttributeList- Child of Arraylist, specific usage for Mbean LinkedList RoleList -Child of Arraylist RoleUnresolvedList - Child of Arraylist Stack Vector  Main Differences between arraylist and linkedlist  Arraylist holds references of object at each position.</description>
